# sjoelbakje - the lasercut

A Dutch ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± game, which usually is played with the family and during Easter or some other holiday. Check [Wikipedia](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sjoelen) for more details. This is a very small (desktop size) version, which is made specifically for The Next Web as we wanted people to do something fun and Dutch at our (also very small) booth.

## Assemble 

- The parts only fit one way, please check before glueing them together.
- We recommend use 10 cent (EUR) coins as disks.
- To make sure your hands don't get black from the burn, use a fernis after lasercutting.
